# HeadCount 2.0

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.  

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.  

In the spirit of TDD we have created some unit tests for you to start off with. These tests will help you break out calculation logic into a `DistrictRepository` class. After you finish `iteration 1` you'll move on to creating the rest of the react application on your own, with the expectation that you will continue to test the application on your own.

This application was built using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. This boilerplate provides a lot of build in content and dependencies for free. Take a few minutes to read through [the documentation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and remember to refer back to these docs if you run into unexpected issues.
